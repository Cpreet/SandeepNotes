### Arithmetic Operators
1. **Basic Arithmetic Operations**  
   - What is the difference between the `+` and `-` operators in JavaScript?  
   - How does the `++` operator work in JavaScript? Provide an example.  
   - What will be the result of `10 % 3` in JavaScript, and why?  

2. **Advanced Arithmetic**  
   - Explain the `**` operator in JavaScript.  
   - What will the expression `let x = 2; x **= 3;` evaluate to?

### Assignment Operators
3. **Simple Assignments**  
   - What does the `+=` operator do in JavaScript?  
   - How does the `-=` operator modify the value of a variable?  

4. **Complex Assignment**  
   - If `let x = 5; x *= 3;`, what will be the value of `x`?

### Comparison Operators
5. **Equality vs Strict Equality**  
   - What is the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript?  
   - Why does `0 == false` return `true` but `0 === false` return `false`?  

6. **Other Comparisons**  
   - What is the result of `"5" > 3` in JavaScript, and why?  
   - Explain the difference between `!=` and `!==`.

### Logical Operators
7. **Combining Conditions**  
   - What does the `&&` operator do? Provide an example.  
   - What is the role of `||` in JavaScript?  
   - How does the `!` operator invert Boolean values?  

### Ternary Operator
8. **Shorthand Conditional**  
   - Write a JavaScript expression using the ternary operator to check if a number is even or odd.  

### Conditionals
9. **If Statement**  
   - How does an `if` statement work in JavaScript?  
   - Provide an example where an `if` statement is used to validate user input.

10. **If...else Statement**  
    - When would you use an `if...else` statement?  
    - Rewrite the following code using an `if...else` statement:  
      ```javascript
      let isValid = true;
      console.log(isValid ? "Valid" : "Invalid");
      ```

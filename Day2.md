## JavaScript operators

JavaScript operators are symbols used to perform specific operations on values or variables.

They can be classified as:

1. Arithmetic Operators
Perform mathematical calculations.
- `+` (Addition)
- `-` (Subtraction)
- `*` (Multiplication)
- `/` (Division)
- `%` (Modulus)
- `**` (Exponentiation)
- `++` (Increment)
- `--` (Decrement)

2. Assignment Operators
Assign values to variables.
- `=` (Assign)
- `+=` (Add and assign)
- `-=` (Subtract and assign)
- `*=` (Multiply and assign)
- `/=` (Divide and assign)
- `%=` (Modulus and assign)

3. Comparison Operators
Compare values and return a Boolean.
- `==` (Equal to)
- `===` (Strict equal to)
- `!=` (Not equal to)
- `!==` (Strict not equal to)
- `>` (Greater than)
- `<` (Less than)
- `>=` (Greater than or equal to)
- `<=` (Less than or equal to)

4. Logical Operators
Combine Boolean values.
- `&&` (Logical AND)
- `||` (Logical OR)
- `!` (Logical NOT)

5. Ternary Operator
A shorthand for conditional statements:
`condition ? expr1 : expr2`

## CONDITIONALS

1. If Statement
Executes a block of code if the condition is true.
```javascript
if (condition) {
    // Code to execute if condition is true
}
```


2. If… else Statement
Adds an alternative block if the condition is false.
```javascript
if (condition) {
    // Code to execute if condition is true
} else {
    // Code to execute if condition is false
}
```
